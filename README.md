# Patches
The Patches folder contains several Pure Data and Max/MSP patches I have created for music and installations. Some include libraries/objects needed for the patch to work, such is the case for instance of the HOA and RTC libraries or Rui Penha's markov's object for MAX. Some patches feature images and soundfiles that I may not own rights to, for this reason, please use the patches only as reference unless its free use is expressly specified within the patch. If you need any information feel free to contact me at rizumirai@protonmail.com .
